            <h2>A Little About Me:</h2>
            <ol>
             <li>I've always had a knack for languages. German was my first and only language I was really exposed to for the first 3 years of my life.</li>
             <li>After high school, I attended the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington in pursuit of a B.S. in Geology. </li>
             <li>I transferred to the University of Colorado - Boulder in 2016 graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in Environmental Studies, summa cum laude. </li>
             <li>After I graduated, I started working for my friend's e-commerce start-up, All-Star Nutrition. Because we were such a small company, I had the opprortunity to work on many different projects and tasks including data analytics and some (minimal) web development. I realized that the small coding experience I had at the time had been one of my most favorite aspects of my job. </li>
             <li>That's what led me to Flatiron School!</li>
            </ol>
